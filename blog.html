            <h2 class="fs-2">What is the Differene between var let and constant?</h2>
            <P class="fs-4 fw-light text-muted">=> Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate
                function body. Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can
                be accessed in their enclosing scope even before they are declared.
                Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have scope to
                the immediate enclosing block. Var can be upadated and redelared into the scope. Let can be just
                updateable and Constant can't be update or redeclare. </P>
            <h2 class="fs-2 mt-1">What is the Differene between arrow function regular function?</h2>
            <p class="fs-4 fw-light text-muted">=> The arrow function is only callable and not constructible. The arrow
                Functions can never be used as constructor function. Regular funcitons created using function
                declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Regular funciton can be called using "new"
                keyword.</p>
            <h2 class="fs-2 mt-1">why use template string?</h2>
            <p class="fs-4 fw-light text-muted">=> Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters
                Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings. By using tempalte string we can
                avoid concatenation operator and improve readability of our code. nesting a template is the easiest way
                to have configurable strings. Within a backtick-delimited template, it is simple to allow inner
                backticks by using them inside an ${expression} placeholder within the template. </p>
